# Image

An image can be used to convey supplemental information to the user or as decoration.

## Guidelines

### Accessibility

All images, regardless of use, _must_ have an appropriate alt text to describe the image for screen reader users. If the image _only_ provides visual decoration to the page, be sure to add `alt=""` so that screen readers will properly skip over the element. For more information on how to properly use alt text for images, please refer to the [alt decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/).

### Responsiveness

For more responsive images, be sure to take advantage of the `srcset` and `sizes` props. These are native attributes on the `<img>` tag that allow for greater flexbility across device sizes. A `srcset` allows the browser to choose from a set of predefined images and what sizes those images are. The `sizes` prop will tell the browser which image defined in the `srcset` would be best served at a given viewport size. For more information, please see the MDN article on [responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images).

### Image Optimization

While images can provide useful information to convey to the user, when not careful, they can also increase page load times, sometimes by several seconds. For users with slower internet connections, this can lead to a poor user experience. Be mindful that the images used are optimized in their file size. Unless using images with transparency, formats like `.jpg` can help naturally reduce file size. If needed, consider using a tool to further reduce the image's size.

## Properties

<DocArgsTable componentName="pds-image" docSource={components} />

## Examples

### Default

A default image with a `src` and `alt`.

<DocCanvas client:only
  mdxSource={{
    react: '<PdsImage src="https://placebear.com/200/300" alt="Random Bear"></PdsImage>',
    webComponent: '<pds-image src="https://placebear.com/200/300" alt="Random Bear"></pds-image>'
}}>
  <pds-image src="https://placebear.com/200/300" alt="Random Bear"></pds-image>
</DocCanvas>

### Sizes and Srcset

An image with `srcset` and `sizes` props set. Refresh the browser at `400px` and below and the browser will select the smaller image to render.

<DocCanvas client:only
  mdxSource={{
    react: `
<PdsImage
  alt="Random Bear"
  sizes="(max-width: 450px) 150px, 600px"
  src="https://placebear.com/600/200"
  srcset="https://placebear.com/150/150 400w, https://placebear.com/600/200"
></PdsImage>
    `,
    webComponent: `
<pds-image
  alt="Random Bear"
  sizes="(max-width: 450px) 150px, 600px"
  src="https://placebear.com/600/200"
  srcset="https://placebear.com/150/150 400w, https://placebear.com/600/200"
></pds-image>
    `
}}>
  <pds-image
    alt="Random Bear"
    sizes="(max-width: 450px) 150px, 600px"
    src="https://placebear.com/600/200"
    srcset="https://placebear.com/150/150 400w, https://placebear.com/600/200"
  ></pds-image>
</DocCanvas>
