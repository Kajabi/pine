# Image

An image can be used to convey supplemental information to the user or as decoration.

## Guidelines

### Accessibility

All images, regardless of use, _must_ have an appropriate alt text to describe the image for screen reader users. If the image _only_ provides visual decoration to the page, be sure to add `alt=""` so that screen readers will properly skip over the element. For more information on how to properly use alt text for images, please refer to the [alt decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/).

### Responsiveness

For more responsive images, be sure to take advantage of the `srcset` and `sizes` props. These are native attributes on the `<img>` tag that allow for greater flexbility across device sizes. A `srcset` allows the browser to choose from a set of predefined images and what sizes those images are. The `sizes` prop will tell the browser to use a specific image defined in the `srcset` to be used within a defined set of media queries. For more information, please see the MDN article on [responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images).

## Properties

<ArgTypes of={stories} />

### Default

A default image with a `src` and `alt`.

<Canvas mdxSource={`
<pds-image src="//source.unsplash.com/random" alt="Random Unsplash"></pds-image>
`}>
  <pds-image src="//source.unsplash.com/random" alt="Random Unsplash"></pds-image>
</Canvas>

### Sizes and Srcset

An image with `srcset` and `sizes` props set. Refresh the browser at `400px` and below and the browser will select the smaller image to render.

<Canvas mdxSource={`
<pds-image
  alt="Random Unsplash"
  sizes="(max-width: 450px) 150px, 600px"
  src="//source.unsplash.com/600x200"
  srcset="//source.unsplash.com/150x150 400w, //source.unsplash.com/600x200"
></pds-image>
`}>
  <pds-image
    alt="Random Unsplash"
    sizes="(max-width: 450px) 150px, 600px"
    src="//source.unsplash.com/600x200"
    srcset="//source.unsplash.com/150x150 400w, //source.unsplash.com/600x200"
  ></pds-image>
</Canvas>
