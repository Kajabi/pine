# Tabs

A tabs component to generate all versions of `sage-tab` as outlined in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/sMbtLUHSt2vfKgKjyQ3052/%F0%9F%A7%A9-Sage-components?node-id=488%3A43471&t=5FtThY98rugq7hGi-1).

## Sub Components

### [Tab](/docs/components-tabs-tab--default)

Handles tab logic, requires a unique `name` property to be passed

### [Tabpanel](/docs/components-tabs-tabpanel--default)

Handles tabpanel logic, requires a matching `name` property to be passed

## Accessibility

This component has been built to align with the [W3C Aria best practices for tabs](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/). You get all tabbing, keyboard navigation, focus states, and aria information applied automatically.

In order for all accessibility to properly compile, you must provide a few required properties to the component. 

**1. A descriptive `tablist-label`:** Provides context to screen readers about what kind of tablist information is being presented

**2. A unique `component-id`:** Provides a unique `id` to the tabs component, be sure it doesn't match any other `id`'s on the page

## Properties

<ArgsTable of="sage-tabs" />

## Variant

### Default (Primary)

Default tabs styles

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.Primary} />
</Canvas>


### Availability

Tabs with a more literal tab feeling, used for things like dates or times

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.Availability} />
</Canvas>

### Filter

Pill shaped tabs for filtering data or content

Note: Tabs are likely not a good component to add filtered data to on tab click as each tab has a unique tabpanel associated with it and all content within that panel will change upon tab click

<Canvas>
  <Story story={stories.Filter} />
</Canvas>
