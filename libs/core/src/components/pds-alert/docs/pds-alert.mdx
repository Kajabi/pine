# Alert

The alert component is used to display a message to the user. It can be used to display important information, success messages, warnings, or errors.

## Guidelines

### When to use
- Use alerts to provide important feedback or information that requires the user's immediate attention.
- Employ alerts to notify users about system status, success confirmations, warnings, or critical errors.
- Utilize when an immediate user response or awareness is crucial for a particular application state or after an action.
- For critical updates that must be distinct and stand out from other page content.

### When not to use
- Avoid using alerts for non-essential information that can be conveyed through less obtrusive means (e.g., tooltips, helper text, or inline messages).
- Do not use alerts as a primary method of navigation or to guide user flow.
- Refrain from using alerts so frequently that they become disruptive or lead to "alert fatigue," causing users to ignore them.
- Avoid alerts for information that is not time-sensitive or directly critical to the user's current task.
- Do not use alerts for purely decorative purposes.

### Accessibility
- The dismiss button has an `aria-label="Dismiss alert"` to ensure screen readers announce its purpose.
- Write alert messages that are clear, concise, and actionable for the user.
- Utilize alert variant colors to effectively convey the message's semantic meaning, importance, and type.

## Properties

<DocArgsTable componentName="pds-alert" docSource={components} />

## Variants

The alert component supports multiple style variants to indicate different types of messages:

- `default` - For general information.
- `info` - For informative notices or tips.
- `success` - For success messages and confirmations.
- `warning` - For warnings that require attention.
- `danger` - For errors or critical issues.

### Default

<DocCanvas client:only
  mdxSource={{
    react: '<pdsAlert description="Alerts can also have description text that can be used to provide more information about the alert." heading="Alert heading text" variant="default"></pdsAlert>',
    webComponent: '<pds-alert description="Alerts can also have description text that can be used to provide more information about the alert." heading="Alert heading text" variant="default"></pds-alert>'
}}>
  <pds-alert description="Alerts can also have description text that can be used to provide more information about the alert." heading="Alert heading text" variant="default"></pds-alert>
</DocCanvas>

### Small

Small alerts are used to display a message in a compact form.

Text in small alerts is truncated when it becomes too long for the alert description to fit the screen.

<DocCanvas client:only
  mdxSource={{
    react: '<pdsAlert description="Small alerts use the description to provide more information about the alert, but are truncated when the text becomes too long for the alert to fit the screen." heading="Alert heading text" small="true" variant="info"></pdsAlert>',
    webComponent: '<pds-alert description="Small alerts use the description to provide more information about the alert, but are truncated when the text becomes too long for the alert to fit the screen." heading="Alert heading text" small="true" variant="info"></pds-alert>'
}}>
  <pds-alert description="Small alerts use the description to provide more information about the alert, but are truncated when the text becomes too long for the alert to fit the screen." heading="Alert heading text" small="true" variant="info"></pds-alert>
</DocCanvas>

## Actions

Action items such as buttons and links should be added to alerts using the `actions` slot.

> **IMPORTANT:**
> - In order to adhere to design and UX best practices, only links and buttons should be used in the actions slot.
> - The `actions` slot uses a flex layout automatically, so the actions will be spaced and aligned properly.
> - When using the small variant, only links should be used in the actions slot due to the compact inline layout.

<DocCanvas client:only
  mdxSource={{
    react: '<pdsAlert description="Alerts can also have description text that can be used to provide more information about the alert." heading="Alert heading text" variant="success"><pdsButton slot="actions" variant="primary">Action button</pdsButton><pdsLink href="#" slot="actions" variant="plain">Action link</pdsLink></pdsAlert>',
    webComponent: '<pds-alert description="Alerts can also have description text that can be used to provide more information about the alert." heading="Alert heading text" variant="success"><pds-button slot="actions" variant="primary">Action button</pds-button><pds-link href="#" slot="actions" variant="plain">Action link</pds-link></pds-alert>'
}}>
  <pds-alert description="Alerts can also have description text that can be used to provide more information about the alert." heading="Alert heading text" variant="success"><pds-button slot="actions" variant="primary">Action button</pds-button><pds-link href="#" slot="actions" variant="plain">Action link</pds-link></pds-alert>
</DocCanvas>

### Small with actions

When using the small variant, actions are displayed on the same line as the description.

<DocCanvas client:only
  mdxSource={{
    react: '<pdsAlert description="Alerts can also have description text that can be used to provide more information about the alert." heading="Alert heading text" small="true" variant="warning"><pdsLink href="#" slot="actions" variant="plain">Action link</pdsLink> <pdsLink href="#" slot="actions" variant="plain">Action link</pdsLink></pdsAlert>',
    webComponent: '<pds-alert description="Alerts can also have description text that can be used to provide more information about the alert." heading="Alert heading text" small="true" variant="warning"><pds-link href="#" slot="actions" variant="plain">Action link</pds-link> <pds-link href="#" slot="actions" variant="plain">Action link</pds-link></pds-alert>'
}}>
  <pds-alert description="Alerts can also have description text that can be used to provide more information about the alert." heading="Alert heading text" small="true" variant="warning"><pds-link href="#" slot="actions" variant="plain">Action link</pds-link> <pds-link href="#" slot="actions" variant="plain">Action link</pds-link></pds-alert>
</DocCanvas>

## Dismissible

Alerts can be set to be dismissible using the `dismissible` property. This will add a close button to the alert.

An event `pdsAlertDismissClick` is emitted when the dismiss button is clicked, which can be used to hide the alert.

<DocCanvas client:only
  mdxSource={{
    react: '<pdsAlert description="Alerts can also have description text that can be used to provide more information about the alert." dismissible="true" heading="Alert heading text" variant="danger"></pdsAlert>',
    webComponent: '<pds-alert description="Alerts can also have description text that can be used to provide more information about the alert." dismissible="true" heading="Alert heading text" variant="danger"></pds-alert>'
}}>
  <pds-alert description="Alerts can also have description text that can be used to provide more information about the alert." dismissible="true" heading="Alert heading text" variant="danger"></pds-alert>
</DocCanvas>

### Small dismissible

<DocCanvas client:only
  mdxSource={{
    react: '<pdsAlert description="Small alerts use the description to provide more information about the alert, but are truncated when the text becomes too long for the alert to fit the screen." dismissible="true" heading="Alert heading text" small="true" variant="danger"></pdsAlert>',
    webComponent: '<pds-alert description="Small alerts use the description to provide more information about the alert, but are truncated when the text becomes too long for the alert to fit the screen." dismissible="true" heading="Alert heading text" small="true" variant="danger"></pds-alert>'
