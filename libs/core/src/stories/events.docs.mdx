# Event Handling
Pine tries to adere to the browser standards whenever possible. However, with Web Components there are events that are a result of a direct user
interaction, like `click`, `focus` that bubble just fine from inside a Web Component's shadow DOM into the light DOM. But then we have others,
like `change` event, that don't. The differencce between those events is that the former are defined as
[composed events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/composed), while the latter are not.


We also try to dispatch non-composed events by manually creating them on Web Component's host elements, but they do not behave 1:1 like their native
equivalents. This results in unexpected behavior. Similar to React "swallowing" `change` events that are created in such a way and event handlers set with
the `onChange` prop not being invoked.

Due to that, our components dispatch custom events that are named like the native events they are meant to replace, but prefixed with "pds". So form components
like `pds-checkbox`, for example, dispatch an `pdsCheckboxChange` event. Which custom events are available can be found in the "Events" section of each component's
properties table.

## Examples

These examples show you how to use the custom "pds"-prefixed events with Vanilla JS and React.

### Vanilla JS

```html
<pds-checbox component-id="example" />

<script>
const handleChange = () => {
  console.log('changed!')
}

document.getElementById("example").addEventListener('pdsCheckboxChange', handleLdchange)
</script>
```

## React

```javascript
const MyApp = () => {
  const handleChange = React.useCallback(() => {
    console.log('changed!')
  }, [])

  return <PdsCheckbox onPdsCheckboxChange={handleChange} />
}
```
