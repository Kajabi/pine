# Icon Management
This document describes the icon library, how it's automatically updated, and best practices for developers and designers.

## Icon Updates
The icon library is automatically updated via a nightly build process that runs twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This ensures the library stays current with the latest icons.

Previously, this process could lead to unintended package version updates within your project. To prevent this, the package version has been set to use `*`. This tells the package manager to use the latest tagged version of the icon library.

## Benefits:

* Developers can still update to the absolute latest version by running `npm update @pine-ds/icons` if needed. This will update the `package-lock.json` file with the most recent version.

## Developers

* Using Existing Icons: No action is required to use existing icons in your project.
* Requesting New Icons:
  * If a required icon is missing, but exists in the [Figma Icon document](https://www.figma.com/file/gr2OhPSlvtsYIZQCL5G2ey/%E2%84%B9%EF%B8%8F-Sage-icons?type=design&node-id=2-2&mode=design&t=g5byhDbSokb3hccP-0), the automated process will eventually add it to the library.
  * Once the new version containing the desired icon has been published, run `npm update @pine-ds/icons` in your project to ensure you're using the latest version.

## Designers

* Adding New Icons:

  * Always add new icons to the [Figma Icon document](https://www.figma.com/file/gr2OhPSlvtsYIZQCL5G2ey/%E2%84%B9%EF%B8%8F-Sage-icons?type=design&node-id=2-2&mode=design&t=g5byhDbSokb3hccP-0) before notifying developers.
  * This allows the automated build process to run and update the library before developers require the new icon.


By following these practices, developers and designers can work together to ensure a smooth and efficient workflow for utilizing the icon library.
