# Pine MCP

The Pine MCP is a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that provides AI assistants with intelligent access to the Pine Design System. It allows AI tools to understand and work with Pine components, design tokens, and best practices.

## What is Pine MCP?

Pine MCP bridges the gap between AI assistants and the Pine Design System by providing:

- **Component Discovery** - AI can find and understand all Pine components
- **Design Token Access** - Intelligent recommendations for colors, spacing, typography
- **Code Generation** - AI generates code that follows Pine guidelines
- **Validation** - Automatic checking of implementations against Pine rules
- **Documentation Access** - Real-time access to Pine component docs and examples

Instead of AI assistants making up component names or using incorrect properties, they can query Pine MCP to get accurate, up-to-date information about what's actually available in the Pine Design System.

## Available Tools

- **Component Information** - Get details about any Pine component with examples (markup, props, events, etc.)
- **Design Tokens** - Access colors, spacing, typography tokens with CSS examples (semantic and core tokens)
- **Documentation** - Browse Pine design guidelines and best practices
- **Layout Validation** - Check if generated layout code follows Pine patterns

## Integration with AI Applications

Pine MCP can be integrated with various AI applications that support the Model Context Protocol. Popular applications include:

- **ChatGPT** - OpenAI's chatbot
- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's code assistant
- **Claude Desktop** - Anthropic's desktop application
- **Cursor** - AI-powered IDE
- **Visual Studio Code** - Microsoft's code editor
- **Windsurf** - AI-powered IDE

The configuration depends on how the application handles MCP server connections:

### Applications with Native HTTP Support

Some applications can directly connect to remote MCP servers over HTTP. For these applications, use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pine-mcp": {
      "url": "https://pine-mcp.netlify.app/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Applications Requiring a Proxy Adapter

Other applications expect MCP servers to run as local processes. For these applications, use a proxy adapter to bridge the connection:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pine-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://pine-mcp.netlify.app/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## How to Know Which to Use

- **Try the direct HTTP configuration first** (simpler setup)
- **If that doesn't work**, use the proxy configuration with `mcp-remote`
- Check your application's documentation for MCP integration examples

Both configurations provide the same Pine MCP functionality - they just accommodate different application architectures for MCP server communication.

## Example Usage

Once connected, AI assistants can:

```
Ask: "Show me how to create a button with Pine components"
→ AI queries Pine MCP and gets current `pds-button` documentation

Ask: "Show me all of the properties that are available for the pds-input component?"
→ AI queries Pine MCP and gets current `pds-input` properties

Ask: "What color tokens are available in the Pine Design System?"
→ AI gets filtered list of color tokens with CSS examples

Ask: "Validate this Pine layout code"
→ AI checks code against Pine rules and suggests fixes
```

## Benefits

- **Accurate Information** - AI gets real, current Pine component data
- **Consistent Code** - Generated code follows Pine patterns automatically
- **Time Savings** - No need to manually lookup component documentation
- **Quality Assurance** - Built-in validation prevents common mistakes
- **Up-to-date** - Always uses latest Pine component information

Pine MCP makes it easy for AI assistants to work intelligently with the Pine Design System, ensuring consistent, compliant code generation and reducing the need for manual documentation lookups.
