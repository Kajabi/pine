# Building with Pine
Our design system is the ultimate source of truth, offering a comprehensive and well-structured set of guidelines, components, and resources that empower designers and developers to create exceptional experiences for all Kajabi entrepreneurs. By adhering to our system, we can ensure a consistent, unified, and high-quality user experience across all touchpoints within the Kajabi platform.

## Foundations
Our design system is built upon a foundation of three core visual elements: Typography, Color, and Icons. These fundamental components work harmoniously to create a consistent and cohesive visual language throughout our designs.

## Components
Components are the backbone of our design system, acting as the building blocks for crafting seamless and cohesive user interfaces. Our components are available as web and React components, maximizing usability and ensuring compatibility with different development environments.

Our extensive documentation provides code examples, property options, and best practices for each component, making it easy for designers and developers to understand and implement them effectively. This thorough documentation empowers teams to create consistent", high-quality experiences while reducing the learning curve and boosting productivity.

## Contributing
We firmly believe in fostering an inclusive and collaborative environment where everyone feels empowered to participate in the evolution of our design system. The success and longevity of the system depend on the collective efforts and insights of our diverse team, as well as the users who interact with it daily.

We continuously refine and expand our design system to meet evolving needs and expectations by encouraging open communication, feedback, and contributions from all stakeholders. This collaborative approach helps identify potential improvements and new ideas while promoting a shared sense of ownership and investment in the system's success.

To facilitate this process, we provide [resources and guidelines](/docs/introduction-contributing--docs) for understanding, using, and contributing to the design system. By offering a clear path for participation, we aim to foster a thriving community of designers, developers, and users who work together to ensure the system remains relevant, effective, and resilient over time.

## How to Use

Using Pine's components involves two essential parts: the web components themselves and the design tokens for styling. The quickest way to start is by including the required files directly in your project using `<script>` and `<link>` tags.
