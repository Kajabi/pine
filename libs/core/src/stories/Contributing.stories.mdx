# Introduction
The Sage Design System is built using Stencil JS web components, providing a standardized set of UI components and guidelines for making consistent user interfaces across products. The purpose of this guide is to outline how Developers and Designers can contribute to the Sage Design System.

## Getting Started
Before contributing to the Sage Design System, Developers and Designers should familiarize themselves with its architecture, components, and design guidelines.

## Architecture
Sage is built on the Stencil JS web component library. Developers should understand how web components work and how to use Stencil JS to create them.

## Components
Sage includes a set of UI components used to build consistent user interfaces. Developers should familiarize themselves with the components available in Sage and how to use them.

## Design Guidelines
Sage has a set of design guidelines defined as Tokens, which outline how components should be used and how they should look. Designers should familiarize themselves with these guidelines to ensure they align with the system's visual language.

## Contributing as a Developer
As a Developer, you can contribute to Sage by creating new components, improving existing components, or fixing bugs. Here are the steps you can take to contribute:
1. Fork the Sage repository on GitHub.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Make your changes to the code.
4. Test your changes locally to ensure they work as expected.
5. Submit a pull request to the Sage repository.

When submitting a pull request, include a detailed description of your changes and any relevant documentation or tests.

## Contributing as a Designer
