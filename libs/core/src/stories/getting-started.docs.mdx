# Getting Started

Pine is a library of Web Components crafted by the Design System Services team at Kajabi. It provides a robust foundation for building cohesive and accessible user interfaces. Designed with scalability and performance in mind, Pine enables developers and designers to collaborate seamlessly on consistent UI experiences.

## Repository

The source code can be found in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Kajabi/pine).

## Initial Setup

Follow these steps to set up the repository locally:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Kajabi/pine.git
```

2. Move to the repository:
```bash
cd pine
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
brew install nss  # Required if using Firefox
mkcert -install   # Add mkcert to trusted CAs
npm run setup     # Use the correct Node.js version, found here [.tool-versions]
```

4. Generate a local SSL certificate:
```bash
cd libs/core
mkcert -cert-file pineLocalDev.pem -key-file pineLocalDev-key.pem localhost 7300
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
cd ../../ # Return to the root directory
npm start
```

> **Note:** If starting the development server process hangs, restart it.

## Generating Components

If you want to contribute to Pine by creating a new component, use the `stencil.generate` command. This command will automatically create all the needed files and folders for your component, setting up its name, styles, and tests in the correct location.

1. Move to the core folder:
```bash
cd libs/core
```

2. Generate component:
```bash
npm run stencil.generate pds-[component-name]
```

3. Choose `*.scss` format when prompted.

4. Confirm all folders and files are aligned with other preexisting components.


## Project Setup
The project is divided into two folders, `libs/core` and `libs/react`.

### core
The `core` folder houses all web component files. This is where we build new components in StencilJS.

### react
The `react` folder houses all exported react components.


## Project Commands
The project has multiple `package.json` files for each folder (core and react) as well as a top level `package.json`. Using `nx ...` commands, we can run commands from each `package.json`.

### Commonly used Nx commands:

- Run prettier to tidy up files: `npx nx prettier @pine-ds/core`

- Start up in a local server: `npx nx start @pine-ds/core`

- Run all tests and watch for changes: `npx nx test.watch @pine-ds/core`

> **Note:** commands can also be run as follows `npx nx [package]:task` e.g `npx nx run @pine-ds/core:prettier`

> **Note:** VSCode developers may prefer to use the [Nx Console extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nrwl.angular-console) for running commands.
