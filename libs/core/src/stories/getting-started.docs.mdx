# Getting Started

Pine is a library of Web Components crafted by the Design System Services team at Kajabi. It provides a robust foundation for building cohesive and accessible user interfaces. Designed with scalability and performance in mind, Pine enables developers and designers to collaborate seamlessly on consistent UI experiences.

## Repository

The source code can be found in the [Github Repo](https://github.com/Kajabi/pine).

## Design Files

The component designs can be found in the [Figma Project](https://www.figma.com/design/CC1YmaGKHnsvB28yLY9mEH/%E2%9D%96-Mercury-components?m=auto&node-id=0-1&t=xybx2d1s26U4p0Jd-1).

## Initial Setup

Follow these steps to set up the repository locally:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Kajabi/pine.git
```

2. Move to the repository:
```bash
cd pine
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
brew install nss  # Required if using Firefox
mkcert -install   # Add mkcert to trusted CAs
npm run setup     # Use the correct Node.js version
```

4. Generate a local SSL certificate:
```bash
cd libs/core
mkcert -cert-file pineLocalDev.pem -key-file pineLocalDev-key.pem localhost 7300
```

5. Start the development server:
```bash
cd ../../ # Return back to the root directory
npm start
```

> Note: If starting the development server process hangs, restart it.

## Generating Components

1. Move to the core folder:
```bash
cd libs/core
```

2. Generate component
```bash
npm run stencil.generate pds-[component-name]
```

3. Choose `*.scss` format when prompted.

4. Confirm all folders and files are aligned with other preexisting components.


## Project Setup
The project is divided into two folders `libs/core` and `libs/react`.

### core
The `core` folder houses all web component files. This is where we build new components in StencilJS.

### react
The `react` folder houses all exported react components.


## Project Commands
The project has multiple `package.json` files for each folder (core and react) as well as a top level `package.json`. Using `nx ...` commands, we can run commands from each `package.json`.

### Commonly used Nx commands:

- Run prettier to tidy up files: `npx nx prettier @pine-ds/core`

- Start up in a local server: `npx nx start @pine-ds/core`

- Run all tests and watch for changes: `npx nx test.watch @pine-ds/core`

> **Note:** commands be also ran as such `npx nx [package]:task` e.g `npx nx run @pine-ds/core:prettier`

> **Note:** VSCode developers may prefer to use the [Nx Console extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nrwl.angular-console) for running commands.
